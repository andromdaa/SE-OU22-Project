The User Experience:
  - Portfolio graph view that shows gains/losses
  - Individual stock view (graph)
  - View assets
  - View OPEN/CLOSED orders
  
  
The Stock (Graph) View:
  - The graph line should follow the current reported price for the current stock. 
  - The graph should have two phantom lines, one to represent the ESTIMATED high, one to represent the ESTIMATED low 
  - Each point should represent a specific point in time for a stocks' lifetime
